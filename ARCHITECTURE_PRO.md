### Layer 1: WiFi CSI Sensing (Through-Wall)

**The Batman Technology - How It Really Works:**

#### Channel State Information (CSI)

When WiFi signals pass through walls/objects, they:
1. **Reflect** off surfaces
2. **Refract** through materials
3. **Diffract** around obstacles
4. **Attenuate** based on density

**CSI captures these changes** in:
- **Amplitude:** Signal strength variations
- **Phase:** Time-of-flight differences
- **Frequency:** Doppler shifts from motion

```python
CSI Data Structure:
â”œâ”€â”€ Subcarriers: 30-56 (WiFi OFDM)
â”œâ”€â”€ Antennas: 2-3 (MIMO)
â”œâ”€â”€ Streams: 1-4 (spatial streams)
â””â”€â”€ Time Series: 1000 Hz sampling rate

Total Dimensions: 30 subcarriers Ã— 3 antennas Ã— 1000 Hz = 90,000 data points/sec
```

#### CSI Extraction Methods

**Method 1: Intel 5300 NIC (Research-Grade)**
```bash
# Requires modified firmware
sudo modprobe iwlwifi connector_log=0x1
./csi_extraction_tool --interface wlan0 --output csi_data.dat
```

**Method 2: ESP32 (Commercial-Grade)**
```c
// ESP32-S3 with CSI support
#include "esp_wifi.h"
wifi_csi_config_t csi_config = {
    .lltf_en = 1,
    .htltf_en = 1,
    .stbc_htltf2_en = 1,
    .ltf_merge_en = 1,
    .channel_filter_en = 0,
    .manu_scale = 0
};
esp_wifi_set_csi_config(&csi_config);
esp_wifi_set_csi_rx_cb(&csi_callback, NULL);
```

**Method 3: Atheros AR9xxx (Open Source)**
```bash
# Using modified ath9k driver
sudo insmod ath9k_csi.ko
cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/recv_csi > csi_stream.bin
```

#### Through-Wall Imaging Algorithm

**Step 1: CSI Preprocessing**
```python
def preprocess_csi(raw_csi: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Input: Raw CSI (30 subcarriers Ã— 3 antennas Ã— T samples)
    Output: Cleaned CSI ready for imaging
    """
    # 1. Remove static component (DC offset)
    csi_dynamic = raw_csi - np.mean(raw_csi, axis=-1, keepdims=True)

    # 2. Hampel filter (outlier removal)
    csi_filtered = hampel_filter(csi_dynamic, window_size=10, n_sigma=3)

    # 3. Butterworth bandpass filter (0.1-10 Hz for human motion)
    b, a = signal.butter(4, [0.1, 10], btype='bandpass', fs=1000)
    csi_bandpassed = signal.filtfilt(b, a, csi_filtered, axis=-1)

    # 4. Phase unwrapping
    csi_phase = np.angle(csi_bandpassed)
    csi_unwrapped = np.unwrap(csi_phase, axis=0)

    return csi_unwrapped
```

**Step 2: Spatial Mapping (Time-of-Flight)**
```python
def csi_to_spatial_map(csi: np.ndarray, room_size: Tuple[float, float, float]) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Convert CSI to 3D spatial occupancy map
    Uses MUSIC algorithm (Multiple Signal Classification)
    """
    # 1. Construct covariance matrix
    R = (csi @ csi.conj().T) / csi.shape[1]

    # 2. Eigenvalue decomposition
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eigh(R)

    # 3. Separate signal and noise subspaces
    signal_space = eigenvectors[:, -num_targets:]
    noise_space = eigenvectors[:, :-num_targets]

    # 4. MUSIC spectrum calculation
    angles = np.linspace(-90, 90, 180)  # Azimuth sweep
    spectrum = np.zeros(len(angles))

    for i, angle in enumerate(angles):
        steering_vector = compute_steering_vector(angle, frequency, antenna_spacing)
        spectrum[i] = 1 / np.abs(steering_vector.conj().T @ noise_space @ noise_space.conj().T @ steering_vector)

    # 5. Peak detection (object locations)
    peaks, _ = signal.find_peaks(spectrum, height=threshold)

    # 6. Convert to 3D coordinates
    spatial_map = angles_to_3d_map(peaks, room_size)

    return spatial_map
```

**Step 3: Image Reconstruction**
```python
def reconstruct_through_wall_image(spatial_map: np.ndarray, resolution: Tuple[int, int]) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Generate visual image from spatial map
    Uses Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) principles
    """
    # 1. Create empty image canvas
    image = np.zeros(resolution)

    # 2. Back-projection algorithm
    for point in spatial_map:
        x, y, z, intensity = point

        # Map 3D point to 2D image
        pixel_x = int((x / room_width) * resolution[0])
        pixel_y = int((y / room_height) * resolution[1])

        # Gaussian splatting for smooth rendering
        for dx in range(-radius, radius+1):
            for dy in range(-radius, radius+1):
                if 0 <= pixel_x+dx < resolution[0] and 0 <= pixel_y+dy < resolution[1]:
                    distance = np.sqrt(dx**2 + dy**2)
                    weight = np.exp(-(distance**2) / (2 * sigma**2))
                    image[pixel_y+dy, pixel_x+dx] += intensity * weight

    # 3. Normalize and enhance contrast
    image = (image - np.min(image)) / (np.max(image) - np.min(image))
    image = cv2.equalizeHist((image * 255).astype(np.uint8))

    return image
```

### Layer 2: Sensor Fusion (Camera + WiFi)

**Purpose:** Combine surface and sub-surface data for complete scene understanding

**Fusion Architecture:**
```python
class MultiModalFusion(nn.Module):
    """
    Fuses RGB camera and WiFi CSI data
    Uses attention mechanism for adaptive weighting
    """
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

        # Camera branch (ResNet-50 backbone)
        self.camera_encoder = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
        self.camera_fc = nn.Linear(2048, 512)

        # WiFi CSI branch (1D CNN)
        self.csi_conv1 = nn.Conv1d(90, 256, kernel_size=5, stride=2)
        self.csi_conv2 = nn.Conv1d(256, 512, kernel_size=3, stride=2)
        self.csi_fc = nn.Linear(512 * 62, 512)

        # Cross-modal attention
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=512, num_heads=8)

        # Fusion head
        self.fusion_fc1 = nn.Linear(1024, 512)
        self.fusion_fc2 = nn.Linear(512, num_classes)

        # Encode camera
        camera_features = self.camera_encoder(camera_image)
        camera_features = self.camera_fc(camera_features.flatten(1))

        # Encode CSI
        csi_features = self.csi_conv1(csi_data)
        csi_features = F.relu(csi_features)
        csi_features = self.csi_conv2(csi_features)
        csi_features = F.relu(csi_features)
        csi_features = self.csi_fc(csi_features.flatten(1))

        # Cross-modal attention

        )

        # Concatenate and fuse
        fused = torch.cat([camera_features_attended.squeeze(0), csi_features], dim=1)
        fused = F.relu(self.fusion_fc1(fused))
        output = self.fusion_fc2(fused)

        return output
```

**Fusion Strategy:**
```
Occlusion Handling:
â”œâ”€â”€ If camera sees person â†’ 100% camera confidence
â”œâ”€â”€ If camera blocked â†’ 100% WiFi confidence
â”œâ”€â”€ If partially visible â†’ Weighted average based on visibility score
â””â”€â”€ If conflict â†’ Use temporal consistency to resolve

Complementary Strengths:
Camera:
â”œâ”€â”€ High spatial resolution (1920Ã—1080)
â”œâ”€â”€ Color and texture information
â”œâ”€â”€ Fast (30-60 FPS)
â””â”€â”€ Limited to line-of-sight

WiFi CSI:
â”œâ”€â”€ Through-wall capability
â”œâ”€â”€ Works in darkness
â”œâ”€â”€ Motion sensitive
â””â”€â”€ Lower spatial resolution

Fusion Result:
â”œâ”€â”€ Complete scene awareness
â”œâ”€â”€ Robust to occlusions
â”œâ”€â”€ 360Â° coverage
â””â”€â”€ Multi-room tracking

  - Collaborate with OpenWrt community (router firmware)
  - Provide custom WiFi nodes if needed

**2. Through-Wall Accuracy** (MEDIUM)
- **Risk:** Metal structures completely block signals
- **Mitigation:**
  - Clearly communicate limitations in marketing
  - Focus on residential/healthcare buildings (mostly drywall)
  - Provide site survey tool to assess feasibility

**3. Real-Time Performance** (MEDIUM)
- **Risk:** CSI processing is computationally expensive
- **Mitigation:**
  - Optimize algorithms (C++/Rust rewrite)
  - Use edge computing (Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM)
  - Cloud processing for non-real-time applications

### Regulatory Risks

**4. FDA Approval Delays** (HIGH)
- **Risk:** 510(k) review can take 3-6 months (or longer)

  - Focus on B2B healthcare (not consumer)
  - Build strategic partnerships (Philips, GE)
  - Position as acquisition target

**7. Reimbursement Uncertainty** (MEDIUM)
- **Risk:** Insurance/Medicare may not cover WiFi monitoring
